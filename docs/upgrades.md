In Krew.io, there are 3 main upgrades you can add skill points, which are earned by gaining XP from farming [Crabs](crabs.md) and [Shells](shells.md), fishing, or killing other [Players](players.md) and [Ships](ships.md).

The 3 upgrades to choose from are [Fire Rate](firerate.md), [Distance](distance.md), and [Damage](damage.md), which you can either upgrade by hitting the red triangles above the stats, or by pressing <code style = "background-color: #000; border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">5</code>, <code style = "background-color: #000; border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">6</code>, and <code style = "background-color: #000; border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">7</code>.

<div style="display: flex;">
<div style = "float: left;">
A few important things to note:

 - Your level is capped at 50.
 - Once the point is chosen between the 3 upgrades, it cannot be changed.

Strategical facts to note:

 - A maxed out damage stat amounts to only about 3 extra damage per shot.
 - Just the right amount of distance can provide long-range benefits.
 - A large fire rate works perfectly in accordance with the [Demolisher](/items/cannon/demolisher.md)
