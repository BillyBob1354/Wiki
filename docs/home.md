# Gameplay Basics

## Controls
 * `Mouse` - Control your pitch and rotation.
 * `LMB` - Unlock player controls, hold down to use the currently equipped tool.
 * `ESC` - Lock player controls, releasing the mouse for UI navigation.
 * `Shift` - View the player leaderboard.
 * `Enter` - Send chat messages.
 * `WASD` - Move around on boats or islands. If you are the captain, moving to the sides of ships allows you to turn them.
 * `Tab` - Toggle between individual chatrooms.
 * `1` `2` `3` - Switch the current equipped tool. Selects from the cannon, fishing rod, or spyglass, respectively.
 * `5` `6` `7` - Upgrade a player stat. Selects from fire rate, distance, or damage, respectively.

## Objective
As with most other games of this genre, the primary goal is to become #1 on the leaderboard. In order to achieve such a feat, you can either forage for crabs and shells on [islands](./pages/islands.md) or kill other ships to gain money and upgrade your own [krew](./pages/ships.md).

But you can't do it alone. A krew will provide extra firepower and insight with players of specialized skillsets. You can utilize [traders](./pages/ships/traders/trader1.md) to earn gold quickly, but will be an easy target, requiring a full krew or trusted fleet of ships to protect you.
