# Tools

In Krew, you have 3 tools: a [cannon](/pages/tools/cannon.md), a [fishing rod](/pages/tools/fishingrod.md), and a [spyglass](/pages/tools/spyglass.md). Each of these tools is essential to gameplay. You can also improve your cannon via [upgrades](/pages/upgrades.md) or [items](/pages/items.md).

## Cannon

The cannon allows you to shoot at other ships by pressing `LMD`. It can be selected by pressing `1`.

## Fishing Rod

To fish, cast your fishing rod into the water by pressing `RMD`. It can be selected by pressing `2`. After a few seconds, you will catch a fish which will give you gold and experience.

## Spyglass

The spyglass is used to zoom in your view to see other ships better. It can be selected by pressing `3` and you can zoom in with `LMB`.
