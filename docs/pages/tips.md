# Tips and Tricks

## Personal Finance 

Spawning into the game you will find out that you have no money. And you will make a goal to get more so here's 2 tips in earning money for all 3 spawns (Island Spawn, Crew Spawn, and Sea Spawn).

### Spawning on an Island

Spawning on an island will leave you with a raft and 0 gold; This spawn is a more peaceful way to earn money. As it's suggested to get crabs and such and save up for a trader 1, after so you can now save up to fill up the trader's cargo cap then sell the cargo at another island. This strategy is the most profitable strategy as long you don't die.

### Spawning on the sea

Starting in this kind of scenario would take an aggresive approach to gain more money in the early game. In which you just sink other boats that you find and are able to kill. It's advised not too attack bigger boats since you're a raft and may lead to your death. Attacking other rafts can be profitable if you find a rich raft that is afk. Once you are able to amass more money you can dock on an island and buy a more better boat then a raft and then go back to pirating as usual.

### Spawning on someone's boat

This kind of spawn is sometimes risky as most times you'll spawn on someone's trader that is being attacked or someone sitting on an island afk or being camped. But if you do get a lucky spawn say on the top 1 player's boat you're in luck! *saying that top 1 boat isn't trading across the sea* The best way for you to get gold with a pirate boat is to help out your captain plunder the sea! When you kill someone with your captain, it is advised to quickly pull out your fishing rod to fish the crates the dead boat gives out so you can gain levels and gold. Now if your captain is a trading boat, your best bet on getting money and levels is through asking the captain to share cargo space and trade with him. 


## Shooting

### Turning

When turning your ship and shooting, your shots are a bit higher than usual, so try to aim lower.

### Shooting Behind

Shooting behind you is a good way to get more range in your shots since a person behind you will have less range and you'll have longer range. This trick is useful when running as it will scare off any pursuers as they will be too damaged before they get close to you.

## Builds

Having a good build can result to a succesful pirating day. Every build can vary for each player as one can be just for brute forcers, another one for machine gunners, and lastly the snipers. You can of course experiment which builds you can use to give you an edge in combat. Using items can also affect the might of your build so test those out too with your build! Here's the different type of people for each build types.

**Note: You can always change up you're build and not use the ones said in this wiki for example an all round build which could be 10/1/39 or 10/30/10, experiment on different combos making use of the 3 different upgrades!**

### Brute Forcer

This build uses the 0/0/50 build which is basically all damage. Used with a range item or a damage item, this build can shred any boat with no crew.

### Machine Gunners

This build is the 40/0/10 build, this build will give you a high fire rate and decent damage, paired with a good item that uses more damage and fire rate then this build will shred a boat in seconds.

### Snipers

The one and only "hack" build, This build is used by marksmen who can hit boats from a mile away. The build for this is just 0/50/0. The build was named a "hack" build because some captains don't know how op the build is and how high the damage can go.

## Spyglass and Corner Peak

Spyglass grants extra visibility and makes the fog more see-through, you can use the Spyglass to scout ahead for enemy ships or look for ships to prey upon, experienced players also use a technique called as Corner Peak, as the visibility at the corners of the window is more than the middle. It is recommended to do quick scans of the seas, once every 5 minutes to update yourself about the ships in the area, this is vital in busier trade routes due to pirates hunting for good traders to make money out off.
