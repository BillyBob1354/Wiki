## Island abilities

At each island, you are allowed to:

* Buy [Ships](/pages/ships.md)
* Buy [Items](/pages/items.md)
* Buy/Sell [Cargo](/pages/cargo.md)
* Change/Join Krews that are docked there
* Deposit/Withdraw from [The Bank](/pages/gameplay/bank.md) (only works at Labrador)
Note that upon 8 seconds after arriving at an island, the captain of a vessel will be able to dock the ship, which will make it invincible to any enemies. However, during that 8 second period, the ship will be vulnerable to all enemy vessels, unlike departing, which takes either 5 or 25 seconds instead of 8 seconds and is invulnerable during that wait time.
