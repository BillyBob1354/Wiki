There are 10 islands:
- [Spain](/pages/islands/spain.md) 
- [Phillipines](/pages/islands/phillipines.md)
- [Guinea](/pages/islands/guinea.md)
- [Labrador](/pages/islands/labrador.md)
- [Jamaica](/pages/islands/jamaica.md)
- [Malaysia](/pages/islands/malaysia.md)

- [Barabados](/pages/islands/barabados.md)
- [Brazil](/pages/islands/brazil.md)
- [Taiwin](/pages/islands/taiwan.md)
            
At each island, you are allowed to:
* Buy [Ships](/pages/ships.md)
* Buy [Items](/pages/items.md)
* Buy/Sell [Cargo](/pages/cargo.md)
* Change/Join Krews that are docked there
* Deposit/Withdraw from [The Bank](/pages/gameplay/bank.md) (only works at [Labrador](/pages/islands/labrador.md))
Note that upon 8 seconds after arriving at an island, the captain of a vessel will be able to dock the ship, which will make it invincible to any enemies. However, during that 8 second period, the ship will be vulnerable to all enemy vessels, unlike departing, which takes either 5 or 25 seconds instead of 8 seconds and is invulnerable during that wait time.
